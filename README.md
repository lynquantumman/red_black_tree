@improvement if you can do that with only one class, don't make a derived class from that iteration is a pointer, and the thing in the vector could also be a pointer, at that time, -> is liable to be wrong.

if member variety is a pointer type, the complier will not initialise it to NUll,you'd better use constructor to initialise it.
@caution Symbol ********** means the use of "new"
@need_to_be_done The deletion of the rb_tree 

The writer only realized the building up part of the red black tree.
The searching part and the deleting part will be added.
